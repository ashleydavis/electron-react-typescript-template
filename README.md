# TODO

- TestCafe doesn't play nicely with Mocha. I've had to remove the TypeScript types for Mocha.
- It might be a good idea to replace Mocha with Jest and see if it plays better with TestCafe.

# Features

    - Mocha integration for testing.
    - Live reload for dev and testing.
    - Code coverage.
    - Dependency injection for react components.
